Report: SuperPy Command-Line Tool
This report documents the implementation of the SuperPy command-line tool, which was developed to track inventory for a supermarket and generate various reports and functionalities. Below, three technical elements of the implementation are discussed that are considered notable:

1. Use of argparse for command-line interaction
The use of the argparse module allows users to interact with the SuperPy tool via the command line. 
Argparse provides a simple and structured way to define and process command-line arguments. 
This enables users to specify specific commands and their associated arguments to perform various functionalities of SuperPy. It provides an intuitive and flexible interaction with the program.
This approach allows for easy addition and expansion of commands and arguments as new functionalities are developed.

2. Use of the Rich module for enhanced output
The Rich module is used to enhance the output of SuperPy by adding rich formatting and styling. It provides a range of features such as table rendering and color coding, which enhance the user experience and make the information easily readable and visually appealing.
This ensures better presentation of data, such as the list of available products and the supermarket inventory.

3. Implementation of a product expiration alert
A product expiration alert has been implemented to notify the user about products that are approaching or have already expired. By comparing the current date with the expiration date of each product in the inventory, products that fall within a certain timeframe can be identified. The Rich module is used to display a formatted table with the expired products and products close to expiration date. This feature helps the supermarket chain manage their inventory and reduce waste.
