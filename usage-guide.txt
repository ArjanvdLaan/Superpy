Examples

Example 1: Advancing Time
To advance the current date by 2 days, use the advance-time command as follows:

    $ python super.py advance-time 2
    
    This will update the internal date used by SuperPy and print the new current date.

Example 2: Adding a Product
To add a new product to the inventory, use the add-product command with the product details. 
For example, to add an Apple product bought on 2023-05-15 for $1 with an expiration date of 2023-06-15, 
use the following command:

    $ python super.py add-product "Apple" 2023-05-15 1 2023-06-15
    
    This will add the Apple product to the inventory.

Example 3: Selling a Product
To sell a product from the inventory, use the sell-product command with the bought ID, 
sell date, and sell price. 
For example, to sell the product with bought ID 1 on 2023-05-17 for $2, use the following command:

    $ python super.py sell-product 1 2023-05-17 2
    
    This will mark the product as sold in the system.

Example 4: Listing Products
To list all available products in the inventory, use the list-products command:

    $ python super.py list-products
    
    This will display a list of products with their respective IDs and names.

Example 5: Listing Inventory
To generate a report of the current inventory, use the list-inventory command:

    $ python super.py list-inventory

    This will show the current inventory, including the quantity, 
    expiration date, and other details of each product.

Example 6: Show revenue and profit report
To generate a revenue and profit report, use the report command with the start-date 
and end-date in the format: YYYY-MM-DD.
For example, to show the revenue and profit report with start date: 2023-05-19 and
end date: 2023-05-28, use the following command:
    
    $ python super.py report 2023-05-19 2023-05-28

    This will show the total revenue and total profit of the specified time range.

Example 7: Export inventory data to a CSV file.
To export the inventory to a CSV file, use the export-inventory command with the desired filename:

    $ python super.py export-inventory filename.csv

    This will export the inventory data to the specified csv file.
